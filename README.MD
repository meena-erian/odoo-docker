# Odoo 14 Docker

Dockerized odoo server


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository ```git clone https://github.com/meena-erian/odoo-docker.git```

2. Add a ```production.env``` file to this directory with the variables: ```PASSWORD``` and ```POSTGRES_PASSWORD``` both set to a password for the postgresql odoo database user. The database container will be automatically initialized with the provided information

3. To build and start this project, go to the parent directory of this repository while having docker and compose installed and run ```./compose.sh``` if you're using a linux host, or ```./compose.bat``` if you're on a windows host.


That's it, and you're good to go. The odoo server will be available on port 80 on the host machine. (You can customize that in [/docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml)) A data folder will be created in this folder, that folder contains all of your database and data generated by your odoo instance.

If you'd like to add custom odoo add-ons, you can do so by adding them to the addons folder.
